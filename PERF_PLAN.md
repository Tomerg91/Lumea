# Performance Optimization Plan

## Current Performance Status
✅ **GOOD** - Application has solid performance foundation with room for targeted improvements

## Quick Wins Implemented
1. ✅ Updated dependencies for performance improvements
2. ✅ Added bundle analysis scripts
3. ✅ Performance monitoring scripts added

## Performance Opportunities Identified

### 1. Bundle Size Optimization (High Impact, Medium Effort)
**Current Status:** Need to run analysis
**Potential Savings:** 20-30% bundle reduction

**Actions:**
- [ ] Run bundle analyzer to identify large dependencies
- [ ] Implement dynamic imports for heavy components
- [ ] Tree-shake unused library code
- [ ] Split vendor bundles strategically

```bash
npm run analyze:bundle
npm run analyze:bundle:verbose
```

### 2. Code Splitting (High Impact, Low Effort)
**Implementation:**
- [ ] Route-based code splitting
- [ ] Component-based lazy loading
- [ ] Third-party library splitting

```typescript
// Example: Lazy load heavy components
const AnalyticsDashboard = lazy(() => import('./components/analytics/AnalyticsDashboard'));
const CoachNotesPage = lazy(() => import('./pages/CoachNotesPage'));
```

### 3. Image Optimization (Medium Impact, Low Effort)
**Current Status:** Basic optimization in place
**Improvements:**
- [ ] WebP format conversion
- [ ] Responsive image sizes
- [ ] Lazy loading implementation
- [ ] CDN optimization

### 4. Caching Strategy (High Impact, Medium Effort)
**Implementation Areas:**
- [ ] Service Worker for asset caching
- [ ] API response caching
- [ ] Browser storage optimization
- [ ] CDN configuration

### 5. Database Query Optimization (Medium Impact, High Effort)
**Review Areas:**
- [ ] Prisma query analysis
- [ ] Index optimization
- [ ] Pagination implementation
- [ ] Connection pooling

## Performance Budgets

### Bundle Size Targets
| Asset Type | Current | Target | Critical |
|------------|---------|---------|----------|
| Main Bundle | TBD | < 250KB | < 500KB |
| Vendor Bundle | TBD | < 500KB | < 1MB |
| Total JS | TBD | < 750KB | < 1.5MB |
| CSS | TBD | < 50KB | < 100KB |

### Performance Metrics Targets
| Metric | Target | Current | Priority |
|--------|--------|---------|----------|
| First Contentful Paint | < 1.5s | TBD | High |
| Largest Contentful Paint | < 2.5s | TBD | High |
| Cumulative Layout Shift | < 0.1 | TBD | Medium |
| First Input Delay | < 100ms | TBD | High |
| Total Blocking Time | < 200ms | TBD | Medium |

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (Week 1)
1. ✅ Bundle analysis setup
2. [ ] Route-based code splitting
3. [ ] Lazy loading for heavy components
4. [ ] Image optimization audit

### Phase 2: Moderate Improvements (Week 2-3)
1. [ ] Service Worker implementation
2. [ ] Advanced code splitting
3. [ ] Caching strategy
4. [ ] Performance monitoring

### Phase 3: Advanced Optimizations (Week 4+)
1. [ ] Database query optimization
2. [ ] CDN implementation
3. [ ] Advanced caching
4. [ ] Performance automation

## Monitoring & Measurement

### Tools in Use
- ✅ Lighthouse CI for performance audits
- ✅ Bundle analyzer for size analysis
- ✅ Performance scripts in package.json

### Key Metrics to Track
- Bundle size changes
- Core Web Vitals
- User experience metrics
- Server response times

### Automated Checks
```bash
# Performance health check
npm run perf

# Detailed analysis
npm run analyze:bundle:verbose

# Lighthouse CI
npm run lighthouse
```

## Performance Best Practices

### 1. Component Optimization
- Use React.memo for expensive renders
- Implement proper useCallback/useMemo
- Avoid prop drilling with context
- Optimize re-renders

### 2. Asset Optimization
- Minimize bundle size
- Optimize images and media
- Use appropriate formats (WebP, AVIF)
- Implement progressive loading

### 3. Network Optimization
- Minimize HTTP requests
- Use compression (gzip/brotli)
- Implement caching headers
- Optimize API payloads

### 4. Runtime Performance
- Efficient algorithms
- Proper memory management
- Minimize DOM manipulation
- Use virtual scrolling for large lists

## Risk Assessment

| Optimization | Risk Level | Testing Required |
|--------------|------------|------------------|
| Code Splitting | Low | Basic functional testing |
| Bundle Optimization | Medium | Full regression testing |
| Database Changes | High | Performance + data integrity |
| Caching Strategy | Medium | Cache invalidation testing |
