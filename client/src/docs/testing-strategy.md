# Testing Strategy for Supabase Migration

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the Supabase-powered coaching application, covering all aspects of testing from unit tests to end-to-end integration.

## Testing Architecture Overview

### Testing Stack
- **Unit Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library
- **Integration Testing**: Vitest with Supabase mocks
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright (configured separately)
- **Performance Testing**: Custom performance monitoring utilities
- **Security Testing**: Manual security audits and automated checks

```

## Unit Testing Strategy

### Component Testing
Focus on testing component behavior, user interactions, and prop handling without external dependencies.

**Key Areas:**
- User interface interactions
- Form validation and submission
- State management within components
- Conditional rendering logic
- Error handling and loading states

**Example Test Structure:**
```typescript
describe('SessionModal Component', () => {
  it('should render correctly with initial props', () => {
    // Test component rendering
  });

  it('should handle form submission', () => {
    // Test user interactions
  });

  it('should display validation errors', () => {
    // Test error states
  });
});
```

### Hook Testing
Test custom React hooks in isolation using the testing utilities provided.

**Key Areas:**
- Data fetching and caching
- State management
- Error handling
- Loading states
- Optimistic updates

**Example Test Structure:**
```typescript
describe('useSessions Hook', () => {
  it('should fetch sessions successfully', () => {
    // Test successful data fetching
  });

  it('should handle errors gracefully', () => {
    // Test error scenarios
  });

  it('should cache data appropriately', () => {
    // Test caching behavior
  });
});
```

## Integration Testing Strategy

### Supabase Integration Tests
Test the integration between React Query hooks and Supabase client operations.

**Key Areas:**
- Database query operations (CRUD)
- Real-time subscriptions
- File storage operations
- Authentication flows
- Row Level Security (RLS) enforcement

**Testing Approach:**
1. Use mock Supabase client for predictable testing
2. Test both success and error scenarios
3. Verify proper error handling and user feedback
4. Test caching and invalidation logic

### API Integration Tests
Test the integration with backend APIs that remain after Supabase migration.

**Key Areas:**
- Email sending operations
- Payment processing
- External service integrations
- Complex business logic operations

## Performance Testing Strategy

### Performance Monitoring
Implement comprehensive performance monitoring for all critical operations.

**Key Metrics:**
- Query execution time
- Component render time
- File upload/download speed
- Real-time message delivery
- Memory usage patterns

**Performance Thresholds:**
- Simple queries: < 100ms
- Complex queries: < 500ms
- File uploads: < 30s (large files)
- UI interactions: < 100ms
- Page navigation: < 500ms

### Automated Performance Tests
Create automated tests that verify performance remains within acceptable thresholds.

**Test Categories:**
1. **Database Performance**
   - Query optimization verification
   - Pagination efficiency
   - Index usage validation

2. **Storage Performance**
   - Upload speed testing
   - Download optimization
   - Cache effectiveness

3. **Real-time Performance**
   - Subscription setup time
   - Message delivery latency
   - Connection stability

## Security Testing Strategy

### Row Level Security (RLS) Testing
Verify that database-level security policies are working correctly.

**Test Areas:**
- Coach-client data isolation
- Session data privacy
- Coach notes access control
- Reflection privacy
- File storage permissions

**Testing Approach:**
1. Test with different user roles
2. Verify unauthorized access is blocked
3. Test edge cases and boundary conditions
4. Validate admin access controls

### Authentication Testing
Ensure authentication and authorization work correctly.

**Test Areas:**
- Login/logout flows
- Session management
- Role-based access control
- Password reset functionality
- Account creation and verification

### Data Privacy Testing
Verify that sensitive data is properly protected.

**Test Areas:**
- Personal information protection
- Session confidentiality
- Coach note privacy
- Reflection data security
- File access controls

## Test Data Management

### Test Data Strategy
Use consistent, predictable test data for reliable testing.

**Data Factories:**
- User profiles (coaches, clients, admins)
- Sessions (scheduled, completed, cancelled)
- Coach notes (private, shared)
- Reflections (various templates)
- Resources (documents, videos, links)

**Data Cleanup:**
- Reset database state between tests
- Clear caches and local storage
- Remove uploaded test files
- Reset authentication state

### Mock Data Patterns
Create realistic mock data that represents actual application usage.

**Mock Data Principles:**
- Use realistic names and dates
- Include edge cases (empty fields, long text)
- Test with various user roles
- Include error scenarios

## Continuous Integration Testing

### Automated Test Execution
Run comprehensive test suites on every code change.

**Test Pipeline:**

3. **Keep Tests Independent**
   - Each test should be self-contained
   - Avoid dependencies between tests
   - Clean up after each test

4. **Test Edge Cases**

   - Boundary conditions
   - Error scenarios

### Supabase-Specific Testing Practices
1. **Mock Supabase Appropriately**
