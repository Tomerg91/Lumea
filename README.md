### Testing

Run the landing page tests:

```bash
cd client
npm run test -- --testPathPattern=HomeLanding.test.tsx
```

## Database

The project uses Supabase PostgreSQL with Row-Level Security (RLS) for data access control.

### Setting Up the Database

1. Install the Supabase CLI and start the local Supabase instance:

```bash
npm install -g supabase
supabase start
```

2. Run migrations to set up the database schema and RLS policies:

```bash
npm run db:migrate
```

3. Seed the database with initial data:

```bash
npm run db:seed
```

This will create:

- Admin, coach, and client user roles
- One user of each role type
- A sample coaching session with a reflection and coach notes

### Environment Variables for Seeding

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables (example values):

```
# Supabase Connection
SUPABASE_URL=http://localhost:54321
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZS1kZW1vIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJleHAiOjE5ODM4MTI5OTZ9.CRXP1A7WOeoJeXxjNni43kdQwgnWNReilDMblYTn_I0
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZS1kZW1vIiwicm9sZSI6InNlcnZpY2Vfcm9sZSIsImV4cCI6MTk4MzgxMjk5Nn0.EGIM96RAZx35lJzdJsyH-qQwv8Hdp7fsn3W0YpN81IU

# Seed Users (use secure passwords in your local environment)
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@lumea.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=securepassword1
COACH_EMAIL=coach@lumea.com
COACH_PASSWORD=securepassword2
CLIENT_EMAIL=client@lumea.com
CLIENT_PASSWORD=securepassword3
```

### Testing RLS Policies

The project includes tests to verify that RLS policies are working correctly:

```bash
npm run test:rls
```

This runs a test suite that checks access permissions for different user roles:

- Admin users can access and modify all data
- Coaches can manage their own sessions and notes
- Clients can only access their own sessions and reflections
- Anonymous users have no access
