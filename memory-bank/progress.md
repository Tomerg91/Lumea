# Progress

## What Works (Foundation)
*   Basic PWA structure (React frontend, Node.js/Express backend).
*   JWT Authentication scaffolding (using `scrypt-js` for hashing).
*   i18next setup for internationalization (Hebrew/English).
*   Basic Tailwind CSS configuration.
*   Capacitor integrated for iOS and Android native builds.
*   Xcode/Cocoapods setup completed for iOS builds.
*   **Continuous Deployment setup via Vercel (connected to GitHub, deploying `client/` directory).**

## MVP - What's Left to Build (Current Focus)

*   **User Roles & Auth:**
    *   Implement DB schema for roles (Client, Coach, Admin) & status (pending, active).
    *   Implement Client invitation mechanism (linked to Coach).
    *   Implement Admin creation/setup.
    *   Implement Password Reset flow.
    *   Refine Login/Signup based on roles.
*   **Coach View Clients (Current Slice):**
    *   Backend: API endpoint `GET /api/my-clients` (auth, role check, DB query).
    *   Frontend: `/dashboard/clients` page/component to display list.
    *   Database: Finalize `users` table schema with `coach_id` link.
*   **Session Management:**
    *   Backend: CRUD API endpoints for sessions.
    *   Frontend: UI for Coach to create/edit sessions.
    *   Frontend: UI for Coach/Client to view session list.
    *   Database: `sessions` table schema.
*   **Reflections (Text & Audio):**
    *   Backend: API endpoints for submitting/retrieving reflections (text/audio).
    *   Backend: File upload handling (S3 integration).
    *   Frontend: UI for Client to submit text/audio.
    *   Frontend: UI for Client/Coach to view/listen to reflections.
    *   Database: `reflections` table schema (link to session/client, text content, audio file reference).
*   **Private Coach Notes:**
    *   Backend: API endpoints for CRUD operations on notes.
    *   Frontend: UI for Coach to manage notes per session/client.
    *   Database: `coach_notes` table schema (link to session/client, text content).
*   **Admin Coach Approval:**
    *   Backend: API endpoint for Admin to list pending coaches.
    *   Backend: API endpoint for Admin to approve/reject coaches (update status).
    *   Frontend: Simple Admin UI for listing and approving/rejecting.
*   **Essential Bilingual Support:**
    *   Ensure all new UI components use i18next.
    *   Verify/test RTL layout rendering for Hebrew.
*   **Native App Container (Capacitor):**
    *   Configure icons, splash screens.
    *   Define and request necessary permissions (microphone, file access if needed).
    *   Implement basic Service Worker caching strategy.
*   **Core UI/UX & Styling:**
    *   Apply minimalist styling consistently across MVP features.
    *   Ensure mobile-first responsiveness.
    *   Address basic accessibility.

## Future Considerations (Post-MVP)
*   Tagging system for reflections or notes.
*   Resource Hub.
*   Payment Status Tracking and Reminders.
*   Data Export feature.
*   Visual Client Progress Timeline component.
*   Advanced offline data editing and synchronization capabilities.
*   Push Notifications.
*   In-app onboarding tour.
*   Advanced Admin features (platform stats, announcements, user management beyond coach approval).
*   Comprehensive testing (unit, integration, e2e).
*   Refined error handling and input validation.
*   Accessibility audit (WCAG 2.1 AA conformance).

## Current Status
*   Defined MVP scope.
*   **Deployment pipeline established on Vercel.**
*   Starting implementation of the first vertical slice: "Coach views their Clients".

## Known Issues
*   Potential inconsistencies in existing i18n implementation need review during feature build-out.
*   Styling needs significant refinement as features are added.
*   AI-generated code requires careful review and adaptation.
*   `dist/public` directory needs to be generated by building the frontend (`npm run build` in `client/`) before Capacitor sync/build commands will fully work.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
*   Decision made to use Capacitor to wrap the PWA for native app store deployment.
*   Adopted an MVP approach with Vertical Slices for development.
*   **Chose Vercel for hosting the frontend application due to its ease of use with React/Vite and Supabase integration.**
