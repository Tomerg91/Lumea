## Recent Development Progress

### CI/CD & Build System Fixes

- **Resolved CI Type-Checking:** Fixed persistent TypeScript errors in the client workspace by implementing npm workspaces, unifying TS/React type versions, using root overrides, and isolating the client tsconfig.
- **Updated CI Workflow:** Modified `.github/workflows/typecheck.yml` to run `npm --workspace client run typecheck`.
- Added ESLint as a dev dependency in the server package to fix CI linting
- Fixed GitHub Actions workflow to properly run the linting step
- Added explicit ESLint installation step in GitHub Actions workflow before linting
- Downgraded ESLint to v8.57.0 to maintain compatibility with existing .eslintrc.json configuration
- Added required ESLint plugins (eslint-plugin-prettier, prettier, eslint-config-prettier) to fix linting process

### Supabase Connection & Authentication Improvements

- Implemented a new Supabase URL and API key for the application
- Added a development fallback mechanism when the primary Supabase project is unreachable
- Created a more robust connection checking system in the Supabase client
- Improved error messaging for users when connectivity issues occur
- Added role selection (client/coach) to the signup form for better user management
- Updated the AuthContext to handle user profile creation with role information
- Fixed TypeScript errors in the React components related to authentication

### CI/CD Pipeline Improvements

- Added "check", "lint", and "test" scripts to root package.json
- Added corresponding scripts to client and server package.json files
- Converted JSX files to TypeScript (.jsx → .tsx) for proper type checking
- Updated tsconfig.json for proper React/JSX handling

### Linting and Formatting Fixes

- Ran `npx prettier --write .` and `npx eslint . --fix` extensively.
- Configured `.eslintignore` to exclude build outputs, backups, and temporary directories.
- Adjusted root `.eslintrc.json`:
  - Added `parserOptions.project` pointing to root, client, and server `tsconfig.json` files.
  - Added override for JS files.
  - Added override for `client/*.config.ts` to disable project parsing (`parserOptions.project: null`).
  - Added overrides to allow `require()` in `tailwind.config.ts` and `server/storage.ts`.
  - Added override to disable `@typescript-eslint/no-empty-object-type` for `*.d.ts` files.
  - Added override to disable `@typescript-eslint/no-namespace` for specific server auth files.
  - Explicitly set React version in `settings.react.version`.
  - Disabled `react/prop-types` rule.
- Updated root `tsconfig.json` to include `*.config.ts`.
- Removed conflicting `parserOptions` from `client/.eslintrc.json`.
- Updated `client/tsconfig.json` to include `*.config.ts` and `vite.config.ts`.
- Fixed numerous errors:
  - Replaced `require()` with `import` or allowed via overrides.
  - Escaped HTML entities (`&apos;`, `&quot;`) in JSX.
  - Replaced empty interfaces with type aliases where appropriate.
  - Disabled rules for specific lines/files where necessary (e.g., declaration files).
  - Fixed `no-case-declarations` by adding block scope `{}`.
  - Removed unused variables.
  - Removed non-standard HTML attributes (`cmdk-input-wrapper`).

### ESLint and Type Safety Improvements

- Fixed all ESLint errors related to `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` across server and client code
- Replaced generic `any` types with more specific types like `Record<string, unknown>`, `Express.Request`, etc.
- Created utility functions (e.g., `getNumericUserId()`) to safely convert between types
- Implemented proper type assertions using the `as unknown as` pattern for safer type narrowing
- Added proper type definitions for function parameters and return types
- Fixed potential type safety issues in Express middleware and API controllers
- Improved error handling with proper TypeScript types and type guards
- Used optional chaining (`?.`) instead of non-null assertions (`!`) to prevent runtime errors
- Added interface definitions for previously untyped objects and API responses
- Added type guards to narrow down types when working with unknown data

## Authentication & Error Handling Improvements

- Implemented comprehensive connection error detection and user messaging
- Added DNS resolution checks to diagnose connectivity issues
- Created a consolidated Supabase client module for consistent authentication

- Defined MVP scope.
- Basic authentication flows with error handling implemented.
- UI components for login/signup created with responsive design.
- Theme support and custom color palette added.
- Environment configuration established.
- Network connectivity error handling implemented.
- GitHub repository configured for version control.
- CI/CD pipeline working with GitHub Actions.
- TypeScript conversion for React components completed.
- Role selection (client/coach) added to the signup process.

- **Linting/Formatting:** Significantly improved codebase linting and formatting. All ESLint errors fixed, particularly those related to `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any`. Improved type safety with proper TypeScript types.

## Known Issues

- **TypeScript Type Errors in Server Code:** Errors remain in auth.ts, passport.ts, storage.ts, and other server files due to conflicts between types from different libraries or missing type information.
- Supabase project requires proper setup with correct schemas and RLS policies for all tables.
- Profile table must be created on the new Supabase project.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- **Adopted npm workspaces:** Standardized monorepo dependency management.
- **Enforced single dependency versions:** Using root `overrides` and exact pinning for critical libraries (TS, React types) ensures build stability.
- **Isolated client tsconfig:** Using `extends` provides clearer separation and prevents root config interference.
- Decision to use Supabase for authentication and database services.
- Adopted an MVP approach with Vertical Slices for development.
- Implemented robust error handling early in the development process.
- Created a consolidated Supabase client for better error management.
- Added comprehensive network connectivity checks for better user experience.
- Converted the project to use TypeScript for better type safety.
- Added debugging components and styling to diagnose rendering issues.
- Implemented a fallback mechanism for Supabase connectivity issues.
- Added role selection during signup for better user management.
