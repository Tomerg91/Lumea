## MVP - What's Left to Build (Current Focus)

- **User Roles & Auth:**
  - ✅ Basic authentication with Supabase implemented
  - ✅ Error handling for authentication flows added
  - ✅ TypeScript integration with auth components completed
  - ✅ Role selection (client/coach) added to signup process
  - Implement DB schema for roles (Client, Coach, Admin) & status (pending, active).
  - Implement Client invitation mechanism (linked to Coach).
  - Implement Admin creation/setup.
  - Implement Password Reset flow.
  - Refine Login/Signup based on roles.
- **Coach View Clients (Current Slice):**
  - Backend: API endpoint `GET /api/my-clients` (auth, role check, DB query).
  - Frontend: `/dashboard/clients` page/component to display list.
  - Database: Finalize `users` table schema with `coach_id` link.
- **Session Management:**
  - Backend: CRUD API endpoints for sessions.
  - Frontend: UI for Coach to create/edit sessions.
  - Frontend: UI for Coach/Client to view session list.
  - Database: `sessions` table schema.
- **Reflections (Text & Audio):**
  - Backend: API endpoints for submitting/retrieving reflections (text/audio).
  - Backend: File upload handling (S3 integration).
  - Frontend: UI for Client to submit text/audio.
  - Frontend: UI for Client/Coach to view/listen to reflections.
  - Database: `reflections` table schema (link to session/client, text content, audio file reference).
- **Private Coach Notes:**
  - Backend: API endpoints for CRUD operations on notes.
  - Frontend: UI for Coach to manage notes per session/client.
  - Database: `coach_notes` table schema (link to session/client, text content).
- **Admin Coach Approval:**
  - Backend: API endpoint for Admin to list pending coaches.
  - Backend: API endpoint for Admin to approve/reject coaches (update status).
  - Frontend: Simple Admin UI for listing and approving/rejecting.
- **Essential Bilingual Support:**
  - ✅ Basic i18next integration implemented
  - Ensure all new UI components use i18next.
  - Verify/test RTL layout rendering for Hebrew.
- **Native App Container (Capacitor):**
  - Configure icons, splash screens.
  - Define and request necessary permissions (microphone, file access if needed).
  - Implement basic Service Worker caching strategy.
- **Core UI/UX & Styling:**
  - ✅ Custom color palette implemented with Tailwind
  - ✅ Basic responsive design for authentication pages
  - Apply minimalist styling consistently across MVP features.
  - Ensure mobile-first responsiveness.
  - Address basic accessibility.

## Future Considerations (Post-MVP)

- Tagging system for reflections or notes.
- Resource Hub.
- Payment Status Tracking and Reminders.
- Data Export feature.
- Visual Client Progress Timeline component.
- Advanced offline data editing and synchronization capabilities.
- Push Notifications.
- In-app onboarding tour.
- Advanced Admin features (platform stats, announcements, user management beyond coach approval).
- Comprehensive testing (unit, integration, e2e).
- Refined error handling and input validation.
- Accessibility audit (WCAG 2.1 AA conformance).

## Current Status

- Defined MVP scope.
- Basic authentication flows with error handling implemented.
