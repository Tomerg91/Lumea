# Active Context

## Current Project Status: 93.33% Complete (14/15 tasks done)

### Project Overview
The Lumea Progressive Web App for 1-on-1 personal development coaching using the Satya Method is approaching final completion. We've successfully delivered all core functionality with only analytics remaining.

### Currently Active Work
**Task 14 - Session Data Analytics and Reporting** (Final Task - 0% complete)
- Building analytics dashboard for session data and coaching insights
- Creating comprehensive reporting system for coaches
- Implementing data visualization and insights

### Recently Completed Major Milestones

#### âœ… Task 12 - Recurring Session Templates (COMPLETED)
Just completed the comprehensive session template system:

**Task 12.1 - Database Schema & Models**: Complete database architecture for session templates with template metadata, session structure, recurring patterns, and relationships.

**Task 12.2 - Template Management API**: Full REST API with CRUD operations, template cloning, and recurring session generation capabilities.

**Task 12.3 - Template Design Interface**: Comprehensive template creation/editing interface with:
- Session structure builder with customizable components
- Template configuration (name, description, category, tags)
- Duration and timing management
- Complete validation and error handling

**Task 12.4 - Recurring Session Configuration**: Advanced recurring pattern system with:
- Pattern selection (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, quarterly, custom)
- Interval configuration and days of week selection
- End condition settings (never, date, occurrences)
- Real-time preview showing next occurrence dates
- Comprehensive date calculation algorithms

**Task 12.5 - Template-Based Session Creation**: Streamlined workflow for creating sessions from templates with:
- Three-tab interface (Basic Info, Session Structure, Review)
- Client selection and scheduling integration
- Session customization capabilities
- Template reset functionality and validation

**Task 12.6 - Mobile Template Experience**: Comprehensive mobile optimization with:
- Touch-optimized template management
- Swipe gestures for quick actions
- Mobile-first design patterns
- Pull-to-refresh functionality
- Session creation workflow optimized for mobile
