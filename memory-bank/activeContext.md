**Latest Achievement**: Core authentication system refactored from Mongoose to Drizzle ORM.
**Current Focus**: Resolve persistent linter error blocking password reset implementation.

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Blocker: Linter Error in Password Reset

We are currently blocked on implementing the password reset functionality (**Subtask 1.6**). There is a persistent linter error in `server/src/routes/auth.ts` that prevents the app from recognizing the `passwordResetToken` and `passwordResetExpires` fields on the Drizzle `users` table.

**Error Details:**
- **File**: `server/src/routes/auth.ts`
- **Error Message**: `Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'passwordResetToken' does not exist in type '{...}'`
- **Problem**: This error occurs in the `db.update(users).set({...})` call within the password reset routes. It indicates that the TypeScript language server has a stale or incorrect type definition for the `users` schema, despite the schema file (`shared/schema.ts`) being correct.
- **Attempted Fixes**: Restarting the TypeScript server did not resolve the issue.

## âœ… Refactor Summary: Mongoose to Drizzle

We have successfully completed a major refactor of the user authentication system. All core authentication logic now uses the Drizzle ORM with a PostgreSQL database, and Mongoose has been removed from this part of the codebase.

**Completed Subtasks:**
- **1.1: Configure Passport.js for Drizzle**: `serializeUser` and `deserializeUser` now use Drizzle.
- **1.2: Rewrite Passport's LocalStrategy**: The login strategy now queries the Drizzle database.
- **1.3: Update Express `req.user` Type Definition**: The `req.user` object is now strongly typed to the Drizzle `User` model.
- **1.4: Refactor /login and /signup Routes**: These routes are fully operational with the new Drizzle-based system.
- **1.5: Refactor /current-user Route**: This route correctly returns the Drizzle user from the session.
- **1.7: Remove Mongoose from Authentication**: The Mongoose `User` model has been deleted and the `mongoose` package has been removed from `package.json`.

## ä¸‹ä¸€æ­¥

The immediate next step is for **you, the user, to manually resolve the linter error** in `server/src/routes/auth.ts`. Once that is fixed, I can proceed with implementing the password reset functionality and completing the rest of Epic 1.
