- Implementing proper static file caching with different expiration times based on file type
- Using MongoDB indexes and optimized queries with field projection and pagination
- Implementing code splitting with dynamic imports and React.lazy for better client-side performance
- Using a lazyLoad utility with ErrorBoundary for graceful failure handling of lazy-loaded components
- Using cleanup utilities (useAbortSignal, useCleanup, useSafeTimeout) for memory leak prevention
- Implementing client-side performance monitoring with core web vitals and API response times
- Creating an OptimizedImage component with responsive srcset and lazy loading
- Using mobile-specific optimizations based on device capabilities and network conditions
- Using compression middleware with gzip/br support for reduced payload sizes

- Using BIGINT for all IDs consistently across tables
- Creating idempotent migrations that check for existence before creating
- Creating the database schema with proper relationships and constraints
- Using npm workspaces is the standard for managing dependencies in this monorepo.
- Pinning critical dependencies (TypeScript, React types) to exact versions and using root `overrides` is crucial for stability.
- Isolating the client's `tsconfig.json` using `extends` prevents interference from the root config or other workspaces during type checking.
- The CI pipeline now targets the client's type check directly.
- Using a new Supabase project with updated URL and API key
- Implementing a fallback mechanism for development to ensure continuous productivity
- Storing user roles in both user metadata and a profiles table/structure
- Developing with both online and poor-connectivity scenarios in mind
- Ensuring proper TypeScript configuration for React components
- Using targeted ESLint overrides in `.eslintrc.json` to handle specific file types (e.g., configs, declarations) and rule exceptions (`require`, `namespace`, `empty-interface`).
- Choosing `Record<string, unknown>` over `any` for dynamic object properties to maintain type safety while allowing flexibility.
- Using type assertions with `as unknown as` pattern when dealing with external libraries or APIs that don't have precise TypeScript definitions.
- Using proper type checking with optional chaining (`?.`) instead of non-null assertions (`!`) to prevent potential runtime errors.
- Using Mongoose models with TTL indexes for automatic token cleanup
- Implementing secure token generation with crypto module (48-byte hex tokens)
- Using expiration time of 30 minutes for security tokens
- Adding rate limiting to prevent invitation abuse (max 20 pending invites per coach)

- Using end-to-end encryption for reflection data
- Implementing offline-first approach for reflection submission
- Using IndexedDB for local storage of encryption keys and offline queue
- Implementing background sync for offline data when connectivity returns
- Using libsodium-wrappers for secure AES-256-GCM encryption
- Creating presigned S3 URLs for secure audio file uploads
- Validating file types and sizes before uploading
- Using multi-step UI for reflection creation (text, audio, review)
- Using Capacitor for mobile platform integration

Important patterns and preferences:

- Role-based access control using Supabase RLS policies
- Using auth.uid() to verify user identity in RLS policies
- Using caching middleware for GET requests only, with automatic cache invalidation on writes
- Preferring .lean() MongoDB queries for performance when full Mongoose documents aren't needed
- Using namespace-based cache keys for better organization and selective cache clearing
- Implementing performance monitoring for slow request detection
- Using React.lazy and Suspense for code splitting and better performance
- Disabling React StrictMode in production to prevent double rendering
- Using a consistent LoadingFallback component for all asynchronous operations

Learnings and project insights:

- Supabase RLS policies provide a powerful way to implement application-level security directly in the database
- Using helper functions makes RLS policies more maintainable and reduces duplication
- Testing security policies is essential to verify access control rules
- Idempotent migrations improve reliability and prevent errors during deployment
- The auth.uid() function is a core building block for connecting database permissions to authentication
- Persistent TypeScript errors related to core library types (like React) in a workspace setup can often stem from multiple versions or conflicting type definitions being resolved due to hoisting or incorrect configurations.
- `npm ls <package>` is useful for debugging dependency graph issues.
- Enforcing single versions via `overrides` and exact version pinning is a robust solution for such conflicts.
- Isolating `tsconfig.json` per workspace using `extends` helps prevent unexpected interference and makes type checking more reliable.
- Supabase projects can become unavailable, requiring fallback mechanisms for development
- User roles should be captured during signup for proper user management
- Profile data can be stored in both user metadata and a dedicated profiles structure
- Authentication flows need careful TypeScript typing and error handling
- React imports and hook usage need consistent patterns for proper TypeScript compatibility
- Environment variables should be properly managed for different deployment environments
- Complex ESLint/TypeScript project configurations (monorepo structure with overrides and multiple tsconfigs) require careful setup to avoid parsing errors.
- ESLint rule interactions can sometimes mask underlying issues (e.g., React errors appearing after fixing unrelated issues). Explicit configuration (like React version) can help stabilize linting.
- **Type declaration files (.d.ts) are powerful for extending existing types without modifying source code.**
- **Interface augmentation through declaration merging provides a clean way to extend third-party types.**
- **Selectively relaxing TypeScript configuration options can be necessary in complex projects.**
- **Utility functions for type conversions (like getNumericUserId) help bridge type gaps between different parts of the system.**
- **Using @ts-nocheck pragmas for specific complex files can be a practical approach when full type checking is impractical.**
