**Latest Achievement**: ✅ **Epic 8.1 Complete: Database Schema Migration to Supabase**
**Current Focus**: Continue Supabase migration with authentication system (Epic 8.2)

## 🚀 Major Milestone: Supabase Database Schema Migration Complete

We have successfully completed **Task 8.1: Database Schema Migration to Supabase**, which represents a major architectural transformation of the Lumea coaching platform.

### ✅ **What Was Accomplished:**

**📋 Complete Schema Analysis & Migration:**
- Analyzed all 12 Prisma PostgreSQL models + 15+ MongoDB collections
- Created unified Supabase PostgreSQL schema with proper relationships
- Migrated all data models: Users, Sessions, Payments, Reflections, Resources, Coach Notes, Files, Notifications, Calendar Integrations, Audit Logs, Consents, Password Reset Tokens, Performance Metrics, Session Feedback

**🏗️ Comprehensive Migration Files Created:**
- `20250219120000_core_tables_migration.sql` - All 16 core tables with relationships
- `20250219120001_indexes_and_constraints.sql` - Performance indexes and data integrity
- `20250219120002_rls_policies.sql` - Multi-tenant Row Level Security policies
- `20250219120003_triggers_and_functions.sql` - Business logic, audit logging, automated processes
- `20250219120004_storage_setup.sql` - Supabase Storage buckets and access policies

**🔐 Security & Performance Features:**
- Multi-tenant RLS policies for coach-client data separation
- Comprehensive indexes for optimal query performance
- Automated audit logging for compliance and security
- Business logic triggers for data consistency
- Secure file storage with proper access controls

## 🎯 Current Status: Epic 8 - Supabase Migration

**✅ Completed:**
- **8.1: Database Schema Migration** - Complete unified schema ready for deployment

**🔄 Next Up:**
- **8.2: Authentication Migration** - Replace Passport.js with Supabase Auth
- **8.3: Data Migration** - Transfer existing data from MongoDB + Prisma to Supabase
- **8.4: API Migration** - Replace Express routes with Supabase client-side calls
- **8.5: File Storage Migration** - Move to Supabase Storage
- **8.6: Row Level Security Implementation** - Deploy RLS policies
- **8.7: Real-time Features** - Implement Supabase real-time subscriptions
- **8.8: React Frontend Integration** - Update to use @supabase/supabase-js SDK

## 💡 Architecture Transformation

**From:** Mixed Node.js/Express + PostgreSQL (Prisma) + MongoDB (Mongoose) + AWS S3
**To:** Unified Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage + Real-time + Edge Functions)

**Benefits:**
- Single database instead of mixed PostgreSQL + MongoDB
- Built-in authentication replacing custom Passport.js setup
- Integrated file storage replacing AWS S3
- Real-time subscriptions for live updates
- Row Level Security replacing custom authorization logic
- Simplified deployment and maintenance

## 🚀 Ready for Next Phase

The database foundation is now ready. We can proceed with authentication migration (8.2) since we have:
- User tables structured for Supabase Auth integration
- Automated profile creation triggers
- RLS policies ready for secure authentication flows
- All necessary business logic functions in place
