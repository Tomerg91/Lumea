### Recently Completed Work

#### Task 5: Session Management Live Data Integration ✅ COMPLETE
**All Subtasks Successfully Completed:**

**5.1 SessionsPage.tsx Updated to Supabase Hooks ✅**:
- Replaced `useSessionsData` mock hook with `useSessions` Supabase hook
- Added data transformation layer to maintain component compatibility between Supabase format (id, coach_id, client_id) and component format (_id, coachId, clientId)
- Implemented proper interface mapping and status conversion
- Created wrapper functions for createSession and updateSessionStatus using existing hooks

**5.2 Sessions.tsx Authentication Verified ✅**:
- Confirmed Sessions.tsx already uses proper Supabase hooks (`useSessions`, `useCreateSession`) with authentication
- Verified JWT token handling through `useAuth` context
- Attempted to update sessionService.ts but discovered it's not being used by any components
- No additional updates needed - already properly implemented

**5.3 Mock Session Service Migration Complete ✅**:
- Verified sessionService.ts is not being imported anywhere in the codebase
- Main components already use Supabase hooks directly (best practice architecture)
- No migration needed - components already using proper architecture

**5.4 Real-time Session Updates Implemented ✅**:
- Updated both SessionsPage.tsx and Sessions.tsx to use `useRealtimeSessions` instead of `useSessions`
- Modified imports to include `useRealtimeSessions` from the hooks
- Enabled automatic session data updates via Supabase real-time subscriptions using existing `useRealtimeTable` infrastructure
- Session status changes now reflect immediately across all connected clients

**5.5 Session History & Analytics Integration Complete ✅**:
- **Critical Discovery**: Session history routes existed in `sessionHistoryRoutes.ts` but were NOT mounted in server index.ts
- **Fixed Missing Routes**: Added import `import { sessionHistoryRoutes } from './routes/sessionHistoryRoutes.js'` and mounting `app.use('/api/session-history', apiLimiter, sessionHistoryRoutes)`
- **Authentication Updates**: Updated SessionHistoryPanel.tsx to use JWT authentication headers instead of just `credentials: 'include'`
- **Technical Implementation**: 
  - Added `import { supabase } from '../../lib/supabase'`
  - Created `getAuthHeaders()` helper function to get JWT tokens
  - Updated both `fetchHistory()` and `fetchAnalytics()` functions to use authenticated headers
- **Fixed Route Issues**: Corrected inconsistent auth middleware imports in sessionHistoryRoutes.ts (changed `isAuthenticated` to `auth`)
- **Server Restart**: Successfully restarted server and verified session history endpoints are now accessible

### System Status
- **Backend Server**: Running cleanly on port 3001 with Supabase/PostgreSQL
- **Database**: Supabase/PostgreSQL fully connected, Redis working, MongoDB conflicts resolved
- **API Endpoints**: All critical endpoints operational and responding with proper authentication
- **Authentication**: JWT token system working with proper middleware across all components
- **Dashboard**: Now displays live Supabase data instead of mock data
- **Session Management**: Complete live data integration with real-time updates
- **Session History**: Properly mounted endpoints with JWT authentication

### Next Task: Task 10 - Translation Coverage Audit
Ready to begin comprehensive audit of bilingual implementation across the platform.

### Key Technical Achievements
- Resolved ECONNREFUSED errors across all API endpoints
- Created missing dashboard stats endpoint with role-based routing
- Created missing reflections recent endpoint with mood emoji formatting
- Mounted existing but unmounted notification and session timer routes
- Mounted missing session history routes that existed but weren't accessible

- Established graceful fallback to mock data system
- Fixed critical server startup issues (logger imports, route handlers, environment configuration)
- Implemented real-time session updates using Supabase subscriptions
- Completed session history and analytics integration with proper authentication

### Current Architecture
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite with Capacitor for mobile packaging
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express with PostgreSQL (Supabase) and Redis
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with Supabase integration
- **Real-time**: Supabase real-time subscriptions for live updates
- **Data Flow**: Live Supabase data with graceful mock data fallbacks
