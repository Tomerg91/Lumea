Why this project exists: To create a specialized, secure platform tailored to the workflow and needs of the Satya Method coaching practice, moving beyond generic communication tools.
Problems it solves: Addresses the lack of a unified system for coaches and clients to manage sessions, reflections, private notes, resources, and track progress within the Satya Method framework.
How it should work: Coaches manage their clients, schedule sessions, write private notes, upload/assign resources, and track payment status. Clients engage by submitting text/audio reflections, viewing assigned resources, and tracking their progress timeline. Platform Admins approve new coaches and oversee basic platform metrics.
User experience goals: Create an exceptionally clean, calm, minimalist, intuitive, supportive, and trustworthy interface. Foster a serene, safe, and reflective digital space. Must be mobile-first responsive with flawless Hebrew/RTL implementation as the priority. High accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA).
