# Task ID: 1
# Title: Complete Session Status Management
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement comprehensive session status updates and workflow management for sessions
# Details:
Build the complete session status management system including status updates (in-progress, completed, cancelled), session state transitions, and proper validation. This includes updating the SessionModal component to handle status changes, creating API endpoints for status updates, and ensuring proper database updates with appropriate user permissions.

# Test Strategy:
Test session status transitions, validate API endpoints with different user roles, ensure proper database updates and UI state synchronization.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Update Backend API for Session Status Changes [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create or enhance API endpoints to handle session status updates with proper validation and database persistence
### Details:
Implement PUT /api/sessions/:id/status endpoint to handle status transitions (pending → in-progress → completed, or pending → cancelled). Include proper validation for status transitions, user authorization (only coaches can update status), and database updates using Prisma. Ensure the endpoint returns updated session data.

## 2. Update Frontend Session Components for Status Management [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Enhance session components to display and manage session status changes
### Details:
Update SessionList and SessionModal components to display current session status and provide UI controls for status changes. Add status indicators (pending, in-progress, completed, cancelled) with appropriate styling and icons. Implement status change buttons/dropdowns for coaches with proper confirmation dialogs for status transitions.

## 3. Implement Session Status Service Integration [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Create frontend service functions to handle session status API calls
### Details:
Add updateSessionStatus function to client/src/services/sessionService.ts to handle API calls for status updates. Include proper error handling, loading states, and integration with TanStack Query for cache invalidation. Implement optimistic updates for better user experience.

## 4. Add Session Status Validation and Business Logic [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3
### Description: Implement validation rules and business logic for session status transitions
### Details:
Create validation logic for valid status transitions (e.g., can't go from completed back to pending), time-based constraints (e.g., can't mark as completed before scheduled time), and user permission checks. Implement this validation both on frontend and backend to ensure data integrity.

## 5. Test Session Status Management System [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4
### Description: Create comprehensive tests for the session status management functionality
### Details:
Write unit tests for the API endpoints, frontend components, and service functions. Create integration tests for the complete status update workflow. Include E2E tests using Playwright to verify the user interface works correctly for status changes. Test edge cases and error scenarios.
