# Security Audit and Remediation - Satya Coaching Application

## Project Overview
Conduct a comprehensive security audit of the Satya Coaching application and implement fixes for all identified vulnerabilities. The application is a full-stack coaching platform with React frontend, Node.js/Express backend, MongoDB/PostgreSQL databases, and various third-party integrations.

## Security Issues Identified

### 1. Authentication & Authorization Vulnerabilities
- **Hardcoded Default JWT Secrets**: Default JWT secrets are used when environment variables are not set
- **Weak Password Requirements**: Minimum 8 characters may be insufficient for security
- **Session Security**: Session configuration needs hardening
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Inconsistent RBAC implementation across routes
- **Password Reset Token Security**: Tokens may be predictable or insufficiently secured

### 2. Data Protection & Encryption Issues
- **Encryption Key Management**: Hardcoded fallback encryption keys in CoachNote model
- **Weak Encryption Implementation**: Using static IV for AES encryption (major vulnerability)
- **Sensitive Data Exposure**: Potential exposure of sensitive coach notes and client data
- **Database Connection Security**: SSL configuration needs review

### 3. Input Validation & Injection Vulnerabilities
- **SQL Injection Risk**: Dynamic query construction without proper parameterization
- **XSS Prevention**: Insufficient input sanitization
- **File Upload Security**: Limited file type validation and size restrictions
- **Request Size Limits**: Potential DoS through large payloads

### 4. CORS & Network Security
- **Overly Permissive CORS**: Development CORS settings may be too broad
- **Missing Security Headers**: Incomplete security header implementation
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: Missing HTTPS redirect and HSTS configuration
- **API Rate Limiting**: Inconsistent rate limiting across endpoints

### 5. Information Disclosure
- **Error Message Leakage**: Detailed error messages may expose system information
- **Debug Information**: Console logs and debug data in production
- **Hardcoded Test Credentials**: Test passwords in codebase
- **Environment Variable Exposure**: Sensitive configuration in client-side code

### 6. Infrastructure & Deployment Security
- **Environment Variable Validation**: Missing validation for critical environment variables
- **Secrets Management**: Hardcoded secrets and weak secret generation
- **Database Security**: Connection string security and access controls
- **File Storage Security**: S3/file upload security configuration

### 7. Client-Side Security
- **Content Security Policy**: Missing or incomplete CSP headers
- **Secure Cookie Configuration**: Cookie security attributes need review
- **Local Storage Security**: Sensitive data stored in browser storage
- **Bundle Security**: Source maps and debug information in production

### 8. Audit & Monitoring
- **Security Logging**: Insufficient security event logging
- **Audit Trail**: Incomplete audit trail for sensitive operations
- **Monitoring & Alerting**: Missing security monitoring and alerting
- **Compliance**: GDPR/HIPAA compliance gaps

## Technical Requirements

### Security Standards
- Follow OWASP Top 10 security guidelines
- Implement defense-in-depth security strategy
- Ensure compliance with data protection regulations
- Use industry-standard encryption and hashing algorithms

### Performance Requirements
- Security measures should not significantly impact application performance
- Rate limiting should be configurable and scalable
- Encryption/decryption operations should be optimized

### Compatibility Requirements
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing data
- Ensure security fixes work across all supported browsers
- Support both development and production environments

## Implementation Priorities

### Critical (Fix Immediately)
1. Fix static IV encryption vulnerability
2. Remove hardcoded secrets and credentials
3. Implement proper JWT secret validation
4. Fix CORS configuration for production
5. Secure database connections

### High Priority
1. Implement comprehensive input validation
2. Add proper error handling without information leakage
3. Enhance authentication and session security
4. Implement comprehensive audit logging
5. Add security headers and CSP

### Medium Priority
1. Improve rate limiting and DoS protection
2. Enhance file upload security
3. Implement security monitoring
4. Add automated security testing
5. Improve client-side security

### Low Priority
1. Security documentation and training
2. Compliance reporting
3. Performance optimization of security features
4. Advanced threat detection

## Success Criteria
