# SatyaCoaching Platform - Launch Readiness PRD

## Executive Summary
The SatyaCoaching platform is feature-complete with 100% of core epics delivered. However, to move from "feature-complete" to "launch-ready", critical production infrastructure, security hardening, quality assurance, and operational readiness work must be completed.

## Current State
- **Platform Completion**: 100% of core functionality (9/9 epics complete)
- **Code Quality**: 50,000+ lines, TypeScript strict mode, comprehensive test coverage
- **Architecture**: React/TypeScript frontend, Node.js/Express backend, PostgreSQL/Supabase
- **Problem**: Cannot launch due to missing production infrastructure and operational readiness

## Launch Readiness Requirements

### 1. IMMEDIATE BLOCKERS (Critical Path)

#### 1.1 Developer Experience & Startup

- **Priority**: Critical - blocks all development work

#### 1.2 Production Environment Setup  
- **Issue**: No production configuration, secrets management, or deployment pipeline
- **Solution**: Complete production environment with proper secrets injection
- **Priority**: Critical - blocks deployment

#### 1.3 Security Hardening
- **Issue**: Missing rate limiting, CSRF protection, dependency vulnerability scans
- **Solution**: Implement comprehensive security middleware and scanning
- **Priority**: Critical - security vulnerabilities block launch

### 2. INFRASTRUCTURE & OPERATIONS

#### 2.1 CI/CD Pipeline Enhancement
- **Current**: Basic linting and tests
- **Needed**: End-to-end smoke tests, mobile builds, automated deployments

- **Needed**: Critical user journey automation (Cypress/Playwright)
- **Deliverables**: 10+ E2E tests covering coach and client workflows

#### 3.2 Performance Optimization
- **Current**: Large component files (15-20KB) without code splitting
- **Needed**: Performance budgets, lazy loading, bundle optimization
- **Deliverables**: Lighthouse CI gates, optimized build pipeline

#### 3.3 Accessibility Compliance
- **Current**: No automated a11y testing
- **Needed**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance validation
- **Deliverables**: axe-core integration, keyboard navigation testing

#### 3.4 Mobile Testing & Assets
- **Current**: Capacitor projects compile with default assets
- **Needed**: App store assets, push notification setup, device testing
- **Deliverables**: Store-ready mobile apps with proper metadata

### 4. USER EXPERIENCE & ONBOARDING

#### 4.1 Coach Onboarding Flow
- **Current**: Basic registration exists
- **Needed**: Complete onboarding wizard (profile, payments, calendar)
- **Deliverables**: Step-by-step coach setup process

#### 4.2 Client Onboarding Experience
- **Current**: Basic client access
- **Needed**: Welcome email sequence, in-app tour, first session guidance
- **Deliverables**: Automated onboarding flow with email templates

#### 4.3 Billing & Subscription Management
- **Current**: Stripe integration exists
- **Needed**: Self-serve plan selection, billing portal, dunning management
- **Deliverables**: Complete billing UX with Stripe Customer Portal

#### 4.4 Legal & Compliance Pages
- **Current**: Core app functionality complete
- **Needed**: Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, GDPR compliance tools
- **Deliverables**: Legal pages, cookie consent, data export functionality

### 5. OPERATIONAL READINESS

#### 5.1 Feature Flags & Safe Deployment
- **Current**: No feature flag system
- **Needed**: Gradual rollout capability for safe releases
- **Deliverables**: LaunchDarkly or similar integration

#### 5.2 Customer Support Infrastructure
- **Current**: No support system
- **Needed**: Help documentation, ticket system, user feedback loop
- **Deliverables**: Support portal and feedback collection system

#### 5.3 Analytics & Growth Tracking
- **Current**: Custom analytics hooks exist
- **Needed**: Product analytics, funnel analysis, growth metrics
- **Deliverables**: PostHog or Amplitude integration with dashboards

#### 5.4 Security & Compliance Audit
- **Current**: Basic auth security
- **Needed**: Penetration testing, GDPR readiness, data retention policies
- **Deliverables**: Security audit report and compliance documentation

## LAUNCH TIMELINE

**Target Launch Date**: 8 weeks from start
**Critical Path**: Weeks 1-2 must be completed before any other work
**Parallel Workstreams**: Weeks 3-6 can be executed in parallel teams
**Launch Preparation**: Weeks 7-8 for final validation and go-live

## RISK MITIGATION

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Security vulnerabilities** - Could delay launch indefinitely
2. **Performance under load** - Could cause poor user experience
3. **Mobile app store approval** - Could delay mobile launch by weeks
4. **Data backup/recovery** - Critical for user trust and compliance

### Mitigation Strategies
- Weekly security scans and immediate vulnerability fixes
- Performance testing with realistic user loads
- Early mobile app submission with proper assets
- Regular backup testing and documented recovery procedures

This PRD provides the roadmap to move SatyaCoaching from "feature-complete" to "launch-ready" with comprehensive production infrastructure, security hardening, and operational excellence.
