# Task ID: 1
# Title: Emergency Backend Server Recovery
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Diagnose and fix critical backend server connection issues causing ECONNREFUSED errors on all API endpoints
# Details:
The backend server is completely disconnected from the client. All API endpoints (/api/dashboard/stats, /api/sessions/upcoming, /api/reflections/recent, /api/notifications, /api/sessions/timer/analytics) are failing with ECONNREFUSED errors. Need to check server process status, verify Vite proxy configuration, validate environment variables, and test Supabase connectivity.

# Test Strategy:
Verify all API endpoints respond without proxy errors, confirm dashboard shows live data, ensure no ECONNREFUSED errors in console

# Subtasks:
## 1. Check Backend Server Process Status [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Verify if the backend server is running and check for any startup errors
### Details:
Check if the backend server process is running, examine server logs for errors, verify package.json scripts are working correctly

## 2. Verify Vite Proxy Configuration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Check Vite proxy settings and port configuration for API routing
### Details:
Examine vite.config.ts proxy settings, verify target URLs and port mappings, ensure proxy is correctly routing API calls

## 3. Validate Environment Variables [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Check all required environment variables are properly configured
### Details:
Verify Supabase URL, API keys, database connections, and all environment variables needed for backend operation

## 4. Test API Endpoints Connectivity [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Verify that all API endpoints are accessible and returning proper responses
### Details:
Test key API endpoints like /api/dashboard/stats, /api/sessions/upcoming, /api/reflections/recent to ensure they are no longer returning ECONNREFUSED errors and are properly connected to Supabase
