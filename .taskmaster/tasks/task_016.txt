# Task ID: 16
# Title: Security Vulnerability Remediation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: critical
# Description: Fix 6 high-severity dependency vulnerabilities in client workspace
# Details:
Address critical security vulnerabilities found in npm audit:

1. tar-fs vulnerabilities (2 issues):
   - GHSA-pq67-2wwv-3xjx: Vulnerable to Link Following and Path Traversal
   - GHSA-8cj5-5rvv-wf4v: Can extract outside specified directory

2. ws vulnerability (1 issue):
   - GHSA-3h5v-q93c-6h6q: DoS when handling requests with many HTTP headers

Affected dependency chain:
- @size-limit/preset-app (main package)
- @size-limit/time → estimo → puppeteer-core → tar-fs
- @size-limit/time → estimo → puppeteer-core → ws

All vulnerabilities are in development dependencies used for bundle analysis and performance testing. Fix available via 'npm audit fix --force' but requires careful analysis to avoid breaking changes.

# Test Strategy:
Run npm audit and verify 0 vulnerabilities, ensure bundle analyzer still works, confirm no breaking changes to development tools, test performance measurement functionality

# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze Vulnerability Impact [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Assess the security impact and affected functionality
### Details:
Analyze each vulnerability:
- Understand attack vectors and potential impact
- Identify which development tools are affected
- Determine if vulnerabilities affect production builds
- Research available fixes and version compatibility

## 2. Backup Current Bundle Analyzer Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create backup of working bundle analyzer setup
### Details:
Before making changes:
- Document current @size-limit/preset-app configuration
- Backup client/bundle-analyzer.js
- Test current bundle analysis functionality
- Document any custom configurations or scripts

## 3. Research Alternative Solutions [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Investigate alternative packages or update paths
### Details:
Research options:
- Check if newer versions of @size-limit/preset-app fix vulnerabilities
- Investigate alternative bundle analysis tools
- Research if estimo/puppeteer-core can be replaced
- Evaluate webpack-bundle-analyzer or other alternatives

## 4. Test Automated Fix [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.2, 16.3
### Description: Test npm audit fix --force in isolated environment
### Details:
Test the automated fix:
- Create a backup branch
- Run 'npm audit fix --force' in client workspace
- Test bundle analyzer functionality
- Check for any breaking changes in scripts
- Verify performance measurement tools still work

## 5. Implement Security Fix [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.4
### Description: Apply the security fix with minimal disruption
### Details:
Implement the chosen solution:
- Apply npm audit fix or alternative solution
- Update package.json and package-lock.json
- Test all bundle analysis scripts
- Verify CI/CD pipeline compatibility
- Update documentation if needed

## 6. Validate Fix and Test Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.5
### Description: Comprehensive testing of security fix
### Details:
Validate the implementation:
- Run npm audit to confirm 0 vulnerabilities
- Test bundle-analyzer.js script functionality
- Verify size-limit preset still works
- Test performance measurement tools
- Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
- Document any configuration changes

## 7. Update Security Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.6
### Description: Document security remediation process
### Details:
Create security documentation:
- Document vulnerabilities found and fixed
- Record remediation steps taken
- Update dependency management guidelines
- Add security audit to CI/CD checklist
- Create process for regular security audits
